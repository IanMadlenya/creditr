CDS Package
--------------------------------------------------------
A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement between two
counterparties in which the buyer pays a fixed periodic coupon to the
seller in exchange for protection in the case of a credit event. The
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has created a
set of standard terms for CDS contracts, the so-called ''Standard
Model.'' This allows market participants to calculate cash settlement
from conventional spread quotations, convert between conventional
spread and upfront payments, and build the yield curve of a CDS. The
**CDS** package implements the Standard Model, allowing users to
value credit default swaps and calculate various risk measures
associated with these instruments.
