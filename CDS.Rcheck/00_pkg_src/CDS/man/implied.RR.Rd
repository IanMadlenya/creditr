\title{Calculates RR}
\usage{
implied.RR(data, spread.var = "spread", pd.var = "pd",
  end.date.var = "end.date", date.var = "date")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe containing the 1. probability of default (pd) over a
a certain tenor period, 2. id and 3. spread}

\item{spread.var}{name of the column containing the spread}

\item{end.date.var}{name of the column containing the end dates or maturity dates.
This is when the contract expires and protection ends. Any default after
this date does not trigger a payment.}

\item{date.var}{name of the column containing the trade dates.}

\item{pd.var}{name of the column containing the probability of default rates.}
}
\value{
implied recovery rate in percentage based on the general approximation
for a probability of default in the Bloomberg manual. The actual calculation uses
a complicated bootstrapping process, so the results may be marginally different.
}
\description{
\code{implied.RR} that calculates the implied recovery rate.
}
\details{
Function that uses the ISDA model to calculate the implied recovery
rate for cases in which we have a spread and a probability of
default (pd).  This takes a data frame of inputs and returns a
vector of the same length. If we have a data frame like:
id,spread,pd which we pass into a function, this then returns a
vector of implied default rates.
