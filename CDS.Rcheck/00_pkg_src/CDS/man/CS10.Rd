\title{Calculate CS10}
\usage{
CS10(x, date.var = "date", currency.var = "currency",
  maturity.var = "maturity", tenor.var = "tenor", spread.var = "spread",
  coupon.var = "coupon", RR.var = "recovery.rate",
  notional.var = "notional")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame, contains all the relevant columns.}

\item{date.var}{character, column in x containing date variable.}

\item{currency.var}{character, column in x containing currency.}

\item{maturity.var}{character, column in x containing maturity date.}

\item{tenor.var}{character, column in x containing tenors.}

\item{spread.var}{character, column in x containing spread in basis points.}

\item{coupon.var}{character, column in x containing coupon rates in basis
points. It specifies the payment amount from the protection buyer to the
seller on an annual basis.}

\item{RR.var}{character, column in x containing recovery rates. ISDA model
standard recovery rate asscumption is 0.4.}

\item{notional.var}{character, column in x containing the amount of the
  underlying asset on which the payments are based.}
}
\value{
a vector containing the change in upfront in units of currency.var
  when spread increase by 10%, for each corresponding CDS contract.
}
\description{
\code{CS10} calculates the change in upfront value when the spread rises by
10%, also known as the CS10 of a contract.
