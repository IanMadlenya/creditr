Description: CDS package provides useful tools for pricing credit
    default swaps (CDS). It enables CDS class object which has slots as
    name, contract, RED, date, spread, maturity, teno, coupon, recovery,
    currency, notional, principal, accrual, pd, price, upfront,
    spread.DV01, IR.DV01 and rec.risk.01, with S4 methods like update,
    show and summary. It also supports data frame input and is able to
    provide convenient calculation of key CDS statistics through functions
    like CS10, IR.DV01, rec.risk.01 and spread.DV01. Of other major
    functions, spread.to.upfront and upfront.to.spread are designed to
    compute one of spread and upfront given the other; spread.to.pd and
    pd.to.spread, similarly, can calculate one of spread and probability
    of default given the other; add.dates and add.conventions compute a
    series of dates information and accounting conventions related to CDS
    pricing. Finally, get.rates and build.rates facilitates direct
    fetching of relevant interest rates from online sources.
