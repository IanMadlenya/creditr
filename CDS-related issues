## Preferably do all these before 2012 because I haven't found inaccuracies for cases in the
## last two years

## 1. when the trade date is right after a roll date. Eg June 23 (roll date is June 20). 

## DONE: 2. when the maturity date lands on a weekend. Right now, if you don't provide a maturity date,
## and you provide just the tenor, get.date returns a maturity date or enddate which has to 
## be a weekday. (This test case is added to test.get.date.R, but commented out because get.date()
## coerce endDate to be weekday for now)

## 3. when the trade date is on a holiday that is a holiday only for that specific region for 
## USD, JPY & EUR (like July 4 is only a holiday in US).

## 4. when the basedate happens to land on a holiday, for JPY, USD & EUR. Basedate is T+2 weekdays (for non-JPY) 
## and T+2 business days (for JPY).

## DONE: 5. When TDate is one day before the maturity date (added to test.get.date)

## 6. Where TDate is Monday (I doubt why this has to be tested? )

## 7. Where Spread is very high. Like if coupon =  100, spread = 1100
##
## Just check if firstcoupondate, pencoupondate, stepindate, maturity date (enddate), 
## startdate, benchmarkdate should or should not be on a weekend, or holiday.
##
## Rec Risk 01 was problematic. More test cases needed there (ask for BB screenshots from Dave).
## PV.01 test case if George provides the true values to test against.
