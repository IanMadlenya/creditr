\@writefile{lot}{\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces This table measures how several variables---the cash flows for each party, the risk-neutral value of $P$, the mark-to-market value of the contract, the spread, and the P\&L for each party---change as the simple one-period CDS matures. Since this table considers the case in which the reference entity---Alcoa---does not default, the only cash flow is the \$1,000 coupon payment from the Citadel portfolio manager to JPM on January 1. The risk-neutral value of $P$ decreases from 1\% to 0\% as the contract matures. Please notice that this ``linear'' drop of the risk-neutral $P$ which is proportional to the time remaining the termination of the contract is a simplified model, whose complication we will discuss later in this section. The mark-to-market value decreases from \$1,000 to \$0 from January 1 to December 31 and the spread decreases from 100 bps to 0 bps. Note that as JPM profits from providing protection coverage (gains \$1,000 by Dec 31), the portfolio manager loses. On January 1, the P\&L of both parties is 0.}}{9}{table.1}}

It shows the same trade as the above Bloomberg screenshot: a purhcase of senior debt protection of Alcoa Inc with a tenor of five years on Jun. 24, 2014. The layout is divided into four sections: Contract section (left), Credit Curve section (center up), Calculation section (center down), and Yield Curve section (right). In Contract section, the fields are similar to those in Deal section in Bloomberg, except that we have to manually set holiday code (in Bloomberg this is automatically set according to users' input). Credit Curve section shows the term structure in a table, while in Bloomberg term structure is shown in a graph. Notice that we have the advantage of viewing default probabilities at different maturities in Markit, but advantage of viewing different spread levels in Bloomberg. our contract choice is highlighted in blue. The Calculation section is very similar to that in Bloomberg, with small differences explained below. The Yield Curve section shows the LIBOR rates (discount factor) we use, and notice that curve date is adjusted here. }}{38}{figure.5}}
