To-Do List for creditr
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DONE: I also want to change everything to be more Hadley like. For example, function names should have underscores not dots.

- DONE: Read the submission guidelines. Note the importance of running R CMD check â€“as-cran.

- DONE: And ask a question on R-packages about how we force inclusion of creditrISDA. Note that I changed (for the better) how we do this.

- DONE: And we need to update the rates data.
 
- Note that we should do this on both Linux and Windows. (I get some weird warnings on Windows.)
 
- I also want to review the reasons that we get rejected from CRAN before. (The ISDA C code stuff.)

- Where do pdfs get installed in an R package?
