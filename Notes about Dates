## Kanishka's note on what test cases to add

## Checked the ISDA, find out the following:
## link 1: (http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/assets/cds-model/docs/c-code%20Key%20Functions-v1.pdf) (just see the yellow box)
## link 2: (http://www.cdsmodel.com/assets/cds-model/docs/Standard%20CDS%20Examples.pdf) (see whole stuff carefully, especially
##         the examples which are all very useful in determining dates)
## link 3: (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2366447) (comprehensive, but not that detailed and useful since
##         it doesn't touch the details of weekends, weekdays, and business days)
## a. maturity date ï¼ˆendDate) does not need to be a weekday. It remains unfixed, and has to be roll date.
## b. coupondate must be a weekday; if the roll date is a weekend day, coupon date has to be adjusted to business day.
## c. Accrual Start Date must be a weekday. if the rolldate before trade date is a weekend day, accrual start date
##    must be adjusted to next business day.
## d. Accrual End Date (not end date or maturity date, which must be fixed) does not have to be a weekday:
##    for example, if the second coupon payment date is Mon 6/22/2009 (because 6/20/2009 is a weekend day), then
##    the Accrual end date is 6/21/2009, a Sunday.
## e. So according to ISDA date convention pdf, start date and benchmark start date is the same as accrual begin date,
##    this means that startDate and benchmarkDate must be weekdays.
## f. Also, there exists a confusion for valueDate: if you check out ISDA date convention pdf, you will find that
##    if you are calculating "cash settlement from spread" or "spread from upfront", then valueDate = Trade date + 3, 
##    which also means that valueDate can also be a weekend.
##    else if you are "building a yield curve", then valueDate = Trade Date + 2 weekdays (Non-JPY) or Trade Date + 2 business
##    days (JPY), which also means that valueDate can be a weekend.
##    But right now, in our CDS package, I "think" we are treating valueDate = Trade Date + 2 business days/weekdays everywhere
##    And I "think" we are coercing valueDate to be a business day. 



## Rec Risk 01 was problematic. More test cases needed there (ask for BB screenshots from Dave).
## (RecRisk shouldn't be more problematic, because its code is almost identical to IR.DV01 and spread.DV01,
## maybe it's just that the effect of change in RecRisk is bigger than other variable, so it seems that 
## the code of RecRisk is more problematic)

## PV.01 test case if George provides the true values to test against.
